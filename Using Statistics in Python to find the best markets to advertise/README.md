#**Finding the Best Online Markets to Advertise In**

We're working for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming for 59$ per month.

Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc.

We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement.

Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in.
To reach our goal, we could organize surveys for a couple of different markets to find out which would the best choices for advertising.
