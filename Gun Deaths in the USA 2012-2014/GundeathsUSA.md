In this project, I've worked entirely with Python and Jupyter notebook.
The objective was to analyze data on gun deaths in the US during the period of 2012-2014. 
Two different datasets were used: fulldata.csv, census.csv. The first includes detailed data on gun deaths, while the second is a census dataset containing the total population numbers by race which was used to calculate the rates of deaths per 100k inhabitants.
Any questions or suggestions are very welcome.
