# TDI Project Proposal - Find the next big (cheap) tourist country! 
## ... but, what changes come with an increase in tourism?

Tourism as an industry is of particular importance to many countries, being both a very significant source of foreign exchange as well as a provider of direct and indirect employment. The need for accurate tourism forecasting is thus particularly important due to the industry’s significant contribution to the economy [1]. It is one of the largest and fastest growing sectors in the world economy and the economic achievements of tourism are significant. Tourism plays a key role in global economic activity, job creation, export revenue and domestic value added [2].

In this project we would like to investigate what are the main changes to the daily life of the populations of low income countries that have recently experienced a tourism boom. For this case study we started with Portugal, a small European country with a population of 10 million people, which has suffered deeply with the 2007 economic crisis.

Portugal has always been a spectacular hidden gem. Even though it experienced some tourism during Summer for the past decades no one could predict that the rise of shared economy (AirBnB) and low cost flying airlines (RyanAir) would produce such an increase in tourism revenue would happen.

For a couple of years now, Portugal has come out of the deep economical crisis thanks, in great part, to tourism.
But at what cost?

How have people's lives been affected, how is their access to housing nowadays? Most importantly, how is the increase in economical power for the country reflected in the bank accounts of the commoners? The Statistics Portugal portal claims that in 2016, the House Price Index (HPI) increased 7.1% when compared with the previous year. This rate has been galloping steadily being currently at a rate of 6,2% in September 2018 [3].

This study will try to understand the changes that came with the increase of tourism revenue and number of incoming flights to the whole country. Afterwards it will try to find correlations between that increase and the housing price, access to higher education (main touristic hubs vs non touristic), cultural events, and public transportation.

To try and understand why and how this boom happened, we will firstly gather information from travel reviews websites such as Yelp and TripAdvisor and crawl in real time the reviews of tourists. We will gather information on cultural sites, restaurants, natural sites, nightlife, cultural events, and prices. This will be considered our initial features.

Afterwards, the main idea is to train regression models to try and predict which current low income countries will experience a boom in tourism in the near future. This could be useful to some industries and governments, such as:
    - Real Estate: if one can predict which country, region, and city will turn touristic, real estate can start investing in properties in those areas;
    - Local governments: a sustainable development can contribute to more inclusive growth through the provision of employment and economic development opportunities in both urban and rural areas, and promote social integration [2].

The expected outcomes would be:
    - an algorithm to predict which countries will probably experience a touristic boom in the near future;
    - a study on the effects of tourism on the population's lifes, and how it can alert governments to the dangers of quick growth.


After this initial study the idea is to find what came first: the chicken or the egg?
Is Portugal having such a fast touristic growth because of the rising number of incoming flights and shared economy marketing, or is it because of the lovely gastronomy or the stunning beaches? Well... we'll have to save those answers for the end of project!
